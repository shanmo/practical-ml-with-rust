# An ML introduction to ndarray

Happy RustFest!

It's my pleasure to welcome you to the *ML introduction to ndarray* workshop!

The material is structured as a series of exercises, or koans, that you can find in the `src/koans` directory.

You can get started with
```bash
git clone git@github.com:LukeMathWalker/ndarray-koans.git
cd ndarray-koans
cargo run
```
Follow the instructions shown in the terminal to start the first exercise.

Enjoy!

## Requirements

### Software

* Rust 1.38 (or higher) with `cargo`
    * Check [link](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for installation instruction if you don't have Rust installed on your machine
    * If you already have Rust installed, run `rustc --version` to check the version.
      Run `rustup update` if you need to update your toolchain (if you installed using `rustup`)

There are some Jupyter notebooks that you will have to run to perform some data visualisations. Install
instructions for those are in `python/README.md`.

### Knowledge

A basic knowledge of Rust is assumed (the first half of the [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)?).
If you run into any issue with the language, please ping me and we'll sort it together!
