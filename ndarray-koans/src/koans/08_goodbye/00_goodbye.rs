/// Even the best journeys eventually come to an end.
///
/// I hope you found the workshop enjoyable and interesting.
/// As it happens for all types of learning material and teaching mediums,
/// it's difficult to assess if the ground covered was enough, the right amount
/// or too much.
///
/// But I'd like you to approach this workshop as a starting point to go
/// and venture off on your own projects and musings in the ML corner of the Rust ecosystem.
/// Using `ndarray`, if that suits your purposes.
///
/// If you still have some time left before the end of the session (congrats, you
/// were fast!) and you are wondering "What should I do next?", I have a
/// bunch of proposals that might pick your interest:
/// - if you have a background in Python, try to wrap the K-means algorithm you just
///   implemented in a Python package to make it easier to consume for a larger
///   ecosystem of users.
///   https://github.com/rust-numpy/rust-numpy#write-a-python-module-in-rust is a good
///   starting point;
/// - if you are curious to find our how you could squeeze the last drop of performance
///   out of `ndarray`, why don't you try to profile your K-means implementation with
///   something like `flamegraph` ( https://github.com/ferrous-systems/flamegraph )?
///   How much faster can you make it?
/// - you did it once, why don't you do it again? Choose another ML algorithm
///   and implement it in Rust with `ndarray`!
///   Check out https://github.com/ddbourgin/numpy-ml/tree/master/numpy_ml
///   if you need some inspiration/a from-scratch implementation to refer to using NumPy!
///
/// I am sure there are many other venues you can take it from here and
/// I am curious to see them unfold, good luck!
///
/// I tried my best to do a good job preparing this workshop, but it is indeed my first
/// time and I am sure that there is tremendous room for improvement.
/// If you are willing to share some feedback on the workshop, please reach out to me
